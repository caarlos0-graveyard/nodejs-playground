# Question 1

Market Sizing: Public Comparables
For the following series of questions, use Yahoo Finance or Google Finance to look up revenue from the financial statements of public companies. A bottoms-up, constructive estimate of market size is determined by revenue: namely, how much are people willing to pay per year, in aggregate, for this product category? Note that we use the conventional notation of "100M" for 100 million, "1B" for 1 billion, "1T" for 1 trillion, and so on.

# Question 6

Basic Unit Economics

For the following series of questions, suppose that you are building widgets which have the following cost components:

- up front cost (widget design): $1,000,000
- recurring cost (shipping): $20 per unit
- recurring cost (manufacture): $70 per unit
- recurring cost (product liability insurance): $10 per unit


First question: How many units must you sell to break even if selling at $200 apiece?

- [ ] 1000
- [ ] 5000
- [x] 10000
- [ ] 50000
- [ ] 100000

# Question 7

How many units must you sell to break even if selling at $300 apiece?

- [ ] 1000
- [x] 5000
- [ ] 10000
- [ ] 50000 to market is everything, due to the
- [ ] 100000

#Question 8

What is the minimum amount of initial capital required for this business?

- [ ] $10k
- [ ] $100k
- [x] $1M
- [ ] $10M
- [ ] $100M

# Question 9

Suppose you could spend $500,000 to decrease the cost of manufacture from $70 to $50. How many incremental units would you need to sell at $200 for this to be worthwhile?

- [ ] 10,000
- [x] 25,000
- [ ] 50,000
- [ ] 70,000
- [ ] 200,000

# Question 10

Thinking like a VC: What's a doable deal?
For the following series of questions, consider two hypothetical businesses.
The first is a social gaming company which requires three people for six months to build out a product. The timeframe involves wireframing, coding both Android and iOS versions, and playtesting. Assume the annual spend for casual social gaming is around 5B, and the projection is that this product, if successful, will make a very strong 10M per year (.2% of the market) in the first 1 year after launch. Assume finally that the probability of success (of shipping a product) is 5% due to technical risk.
The second is a drug company which requires thirty people for ten years to build out a treatment for a disease. The timeframe involves not just doing the basic scientific research, but going through the US FDA's Phase I/II/III/IV process rather than working from the willing-patient/willing-doctor model of Banting and Best (October 1920 concept to mid-1923 scaled production). Salaries must be paid during this time period. The annual spend for this disease is 10B, and the projection is that this product, if successful, will make an incredible 1.5B per year (15% of the market) in the first 1 year after launch due to IP and regulatory monopolies. Assume finally that the probability of success (of shipping a product) is 5%, due to technical and regulatory risk.
Assume for extreme simplicity that the only cost in both businesses is salary. Assume further that the first business has employees at near-market salary for the Bay Area (say $100,000 per year per person, all-inclusive) while the second business has dedicated, passionate people that will take 50% of market (say $50,000 per year per person, all-inclusive) for the duration of the company. Finally, assume that each company does zero revenue until the launch of their product, at which point they pull up. 

First question: what is the minimum total capital required for the first business?

- [ ] $15,000
- [x] $150,000
- [ ] $1,500,000
- [ ] $15,000,000
- [ ] $150,000,000

# Question 11

What is the minimum total capital required for the second business?

- [ ] $15,000
- [ ] $150,000
- [ ] $1,500,000
- [x] $15,000,000
- [ ] $150,000,000

# Question 12

Assume that a VC is trying to optimize the quantity: 

(QMPSNT)1/T 

Where:

- Q: probability of success, or one minus risk
- M: market size (in dollars)
- P: percent of the market attained in the first year
- S: average salary per person (in dollars per year)
- N: headcount
- T: time to market (in years)

This can be thought of as the amount of money returned divided by the cost of generating that money. Note that for extreme simplicity now we are assuming that revenue linearly corresponds to profit, and that margins are equally high in both businesses, so that we can think of "revenue" as corresponding to "money returned". The exponent comes from the fact that money returned in one year can, in theory, be reinvested in the next year in a new company. Thus a 2X growth factor per year is better than a nominally larger 3X growth factor over two years, as 2^2=4 > 3. (A more sophisticated quantity is the IRR). That said, in general as more capital is deployed the growth factors tend to slow down: it's harder to get $10M from $1M than it is to get $1M from $100k. Still, just by this metric -- which business is better by the measure of first-year-revenue divided by cost to get to first-year-revenue, renormalized for time to market?

- [x] Business 1 (Social Gaming Company)
- [ ] Business 2 (Drug Company)

# Question 13

In this example, which factor contributes most to the difference between the two companies?

- [x] Time to market
- [ ] Salary
- [ ] Probability of success due to technical factors
- [ ] Market size
- [ ] Headcount
